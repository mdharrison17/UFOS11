# UFOs
Module 11

##Project Summary
Use JavaScript to build dynamic table with multiple filters.

Create JavaScript Functions to achieve the following:
  *Build Dynamic HTML table
  *Capture filter input from user
  *Use filter input from user to filter displayed data
  
###Further site improvement recommendations:
    * Could use a data source that is up-to-date and not static.  For example
        scrape a website for up-to-date UfO sightings
    * Could use a map to plot the sightings locations to give a visual to the data
